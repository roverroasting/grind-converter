# Notes

This file will be used to document the working philosophy of the algorirthm.

## Sifter

The currently idea is to design this for the data to be provided by using a [Kruve sifter](https://www.kruveinc.com/pages/kruve-sifter).

## Implimentation

I believe I am first going to explore this with the Laravel Lumen. Why? Because I am super comfortable with their Eloquent ORM and prefer to prototype with it.
